# R_project1

# A Dummy R project that has been created only to check the general ide on how to launch version cotrol with GitHub and RStudio

# The repository in both RStudio and GitHub should have the same name
# Inside RStudio there are several commands that have to be filled before pulling/pushin the commits made, such as establishing the user name, user email, path to GitHub repository

# git config --global user.email "put your email from GitHub"
# git config --global user.name "put you GitHub name"
# git remote add origin "https address to your GitHub repository ended with .git"
# git config remote.origin.url "GitHub URL address to repository ended with .git and started with git@github.com:"
# git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
# git push origin master
# git pull origin master

# The original tutorial that this connection is based on is published on: https://www.r-bloggers.com/rstudio-and-github/
